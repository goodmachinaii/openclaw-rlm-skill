# RLM Engine — Explicit deep reasoning over history

## IMPORTANT: Explicit activation only

This skill ONLY activates when the user EXPLICITLY requests RLM analysis.
Do NOT use this skill based on question complexity — let the user decide.

### Trigger phrases (user must say one of these)

- `/rlm <question>`
- `use RLM to...`
- `analyze with RLM...`
- `RLM search...`
- `deep analysis of...`

### Examples of activation

```
✓ "/rlm how many times did we discuss Docker?"
✓ "Use RLM to find patterns in our conversations"
✓ "Analyze with RLM what topics we covered this month"
✓ "Deep analysis of all infrastructure decisions"

✗ "What did we talk about yesterday?" → Use memory_search (no RLM trigger)
✗ "Find patterns in our chats" → Use memory_search (no explicit RLM request)
✗ "Summarize our project discussions" → Use memory_search (no explicit RLM request)
```

## Why explicit activation?

| Tool | Speed | Cost | When to use |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| memory_search (native) | ~100ms | Free | Default for all memory questions |
| rlm-engine (this skill) | 15-180s | $0.01-0.10 | Only when user explicitly asks |

The user knows when they need deep analysis and will request it explicitly.
Do not try to guess — if they don't say "RLM", use memory_search.

## What RLM can do that memory_search cannot

- Execute Python code to count, aggregate, calculate statistics
- Iterate over ALL sessions (not just top-K matches)
- Cross-reference data across many sessions programmatically
- Detect patterns that require reading complete transcripts

## Invocation

1. Confirm activation:
   "Running RLM deep analysis... this can take 15-180 seconds depending on context and model iterations."

2. Execute:

```bash
cd {baseDir} && uv run python src/rlm_bridge.py \
  --profile-model cost \
  --query "EXACT USER QUESTION (without the /rlm prefix)"
```

3. Handle result JSON:
   - `status: "ok"` → respond with `response` field
   - `status: "rate_limited"` → Kimi API limit, suggest waiting or using memory_search
   - `status: "skipped"` → not enough history
   - `status: "error"` → inform problem, suggest memory_search as fallback

## Technical details

- Models (default profile `cost`): kimi-k2.5 (root) + kimi-k2.5 (sub) + kimi-k2-turbo (fallback)
- Context: loads up to 30 sessions, 200K characters max (configurable)
- API: Moonshot API (requires MOONSHOT_API_KEY environment variable)
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.05 per query (pay-as-you-go)
